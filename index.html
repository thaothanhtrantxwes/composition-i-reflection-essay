                            <p>May 03, 2019</p>
                            <p>Now that I’m so close to the end of Dr. Myers’ Composition I class this spring semester 2019, it’s time to sit back and high-five my better self! Well, actually, how can I know if I’m better?!</p>
                            <p>So, I go over all my Composition I writing projects: from my personal essay, to teamwork profile series, to my summary and response essay, to teamwork informative article series; &nbsp; I am now transfixed by whatever this feeling is—kind of strange, much irritating, and just glad. As so, I’m wording out this reflection essay as a way to slap me in the face. </p>
                            <p>What can I say? English is too much of a language for someone like me. All my life I struggle hard for the ‘I’ of what I see and the ‘a’ of every count in reality. Oops, that doesn’t make any sense. My point is… &nbsp; I feel kind of strange probably because when I’m done reading what I wrote months ago, I see that I’m still the same in my heart, but at the same time I see the distance between then and now, my focus then and now. &nbsp; I feel much irritating probably because what I wrote sounds so emo at times and some parts just sound dead-serious. I want fun now. And I want to sound like fun now. &nbsp; I’m just glad probably because all to me now is not as I remembered it. All my writings were done last-minute, so I remembered each as how it could have been better. But now I’m just pretty chill. After all, it all sounds so-so. I no longer care as much. </p>
                            <p>Recap on my behaviors in class: Bad! Somehow, most of me was in view-only mode, my chill was elsewhere. My behaviors were about wrong, out of sync, might have been misunderstood. But whatever, I then chose to stay in my head for the tough times, and that is not what this essay is about.</p>
                            <p>Next on my study. The thing I love about this class is that I did not at all find myself in situations where I see me sweating and running to meet deadlines, me boring myself to tears just to get things done right. I had the space to freestyle and I had targets to work towards. I feel like I got myself with me every step of the way. I even caught myself in those chains of realizing ‘A’ to realizing ‘B’ and on and on, like I was in some sort of master plan. To sum, I’m sure I’ve learnt a lot.</p>
                            <p>From the bottom of my heart, I very much appreciate being given the chance to be here. Dr. Myers’ plan and feedbacks mean a world to me. No matter what, in me there’s a strong hope to see Dr. Myers later. </p>
                            
                            <p>Oh no, not long enough. Just 479 words right here. This Reflection Essay should be around 600 to 800 words... Whatever, this is it for now. <a id="data-end"></a></p>
